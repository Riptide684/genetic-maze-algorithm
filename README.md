# genetic-maze-algorithm
Genetic algorithm to solve and design mazes

Both files should be stored in the same folder so that they can be imported. Run the "MazeMaker.py" to start the program.

Following libraries are required:

- Math
- Time
- Tkinter
- Random
- Sys

The program uses a genetic algorithm to model natural selection. It won't generate the fastest solution, and it has a time limit of 10 seconds for the genetic algorithm to finish.
